===

Pages
---
### Home
Here users can create new shortened urls by submitting the form on the page. The form has two fields: the long url and the optional custom link for the url. If the user does not provide a custom link, then a link is automatically generated for them. If an invalid long or custom link is given then the page prompts the user to change their input.

Url Generation
---
Urls are generated by randomly choosing characters from A-z, 0-9. Since we want the urls to be short, the generated urls start out with  4 characters and can expand in length if more permutations are needed due to collisions. Four character URLs give us 62^4 (14776336) possible links to start. 

DB Schema
---
The database contains one collection whose contents each have the fields `shortUrl`, `longUrl`, and `views`. In order to ensure this structure, I've added a schema that enforces that `longUrl` is a URL, `shortUrl` is a string, and `views` is a number.

URL Redirection
---
When a user enters a url on the site, the server checks the database to see if there is a corresponding long form url. If so, a server side redirect (301) is issued and the user is sent to the long url. If it is an invalid short url, the server tells the client to display the not found page.
